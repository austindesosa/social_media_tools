# social_media_tools
This file aims to unify code I have written to gather information from social media websites, with code I have written to quickly build, train , and test neural networks using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
Here are a few files found in this repository and their purposes:

somed.py has code to scrape photos and other information from Instagram and other social media websites. It also has some code related to building neural networks.

pyramid.py has code to work with sound files, including speech recognition and manipulating NumPy arrays representing sound. 

test_by_color.py can quickly enact a basic training and testing routine for a tensorflow.keras.Model object. It also has helper functions for preprocessng visual data to set up a test. It quickly sets up an experiment by which it generates images of colors and trains a neural network to distinguish them.

tf_cat.py contains the code to build a dense neural network for binary classificaion, inspired by Dr. Andrew Ng onlinw couorse in deep learning on Coursera.

social_media_tool.py inherits from all of the above mentioned files.
