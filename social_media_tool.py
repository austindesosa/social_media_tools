This file is meant to combine 3 modules I have previously written -- pyramid, somed, and test_by_color.

The file **pyramid.py** is for sound processing and speech-to-text. 

The file **somed.py** is to get information from popular social media platforms such as Instagram and GitHub.

The file **test_by_color.py** is to quickly train and test neural networks to distinguish between colors. This is a dummy task to test network architectures.

This file aims to combine these three into one tool to collect visual and sound data from the Internet and use it to train and test neural networks.
